<br />
> Before the world validates our identity based on race &amp; creed,<br />
> Before they tell us where we belong &amp; which air we ought to breathe,<br />
> For now, for once, let's just live for today!
> Before life drags us apart and tries molding our fate,<br />
> Before fanaticism conquers love &amp; our credibility is put on stake,<br />
> For now, for once, let's just live for today!
> Before the night looses its charm &amp; the moon hides &amp; fades,<br />
> Before the first gleam of sunshine makes them discover our shade,<br />
> For now, for once, let's just live for today!</p>
> Before social apprehensions make us kneel &amp; break,<br />
> Before we're made to choose between the obvious &amp; man-made,<br />
> For now, for once, let's just live for today!<br />
