<p>Hello Bloggers!</p>
<p>Let me start by telling you what took so long for the first post to come up! After registering with GoDaddy for the domain, I've been waiting for my friend Shailesh (An awesome designer btw) to give me a wicked cool custom theme. You don't expect me to start with a drab page, right? But alas, here we are. </p>

He got busy with other things and I'm stuck with some random theme for now. I'm pretty decent with front-end myself so if this post can't prod him enough to give me a theme soon, then I may take a crack at it myself.

<p>Anyway...So, what can you expect from this blog? Bunch of randomness. Right fromÂ plebeian rants to life changing experiences, some awesome technology I've come across to crazy hacks that I've seen, I'll try and note it down as much as possible. Hopefully, I'll be able to connect with some of you with what I've to say. For others, I'm all in for a good debate.</p>
<p>You can expect some content rolling in as soon as I setup some basic pages here. I'm still finalizing on the hosting service for this blog. Signing off for now.</p>
<p>Till we meet again.</p>
