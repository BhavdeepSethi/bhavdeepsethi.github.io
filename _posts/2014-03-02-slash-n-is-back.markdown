<p>P.S.: Watch out for my talk on <strong>Know Your Customer (KYC) ~ Deriving User Insights</strong>. Here is the synopsis of the talk: </p>
<p><em>How can we customize every customer engagement through event derivations? How can we ensure every user interaction is relevant and drive loyalty and retention through it? Did you know it also enables finding who is a reseller, who is a Frequent shopper at Flipkart and who needs a mailer to be brought back? How do we improve customer support interaction by knowing who is anxious, who is happy and who is an angry repeat caller. Presenting the "User Insights Platform" which enables us to dig into 100s of TB of data at Flipkart to derive insights about the user.</em></p>
