> I always wonder why birds stay in the same place when they can fly anywhere on the earth. Then I ask myself the same question. <br />

> It doesn’t matter how many times you fail. It doesn’t matter how many times you almost get it right. No one is going to know or care about your failures, and neither should you. All you have to do is learn from them and those around you. Because all that matters in business is that you get it right once. Then everyone can tell you how lucky you are.<br />

> When they score the winning point or sell their company for millions &#8211; you&#8217;re seeing them in their moment of glory. What you don&#8217;t see is the thousands of hours of preparation. You don&#8217;t see the self doubt, the lost sleep, the lonely nights spent working. You don&#8217;t see the moment they started. The moment they were just like you, wondering how they could ever be good.<br />

> It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.<br />
<cite>Theodore Roosevelt, The Man in the Arena</cite>

> In light of knowledge attained, the happy achievement seems almost a matter of course, and any intelligent student can grasp it without too much trouble. But the years of anxious searching in the dark, with their intense longing, their alterations of confidence and exhaustion and the final emergence into the light &#8212; only those who have experienced it can understand it.<br />

> Your time is limited, so don&#8217;t waste it living someone else&#8217;s life. Don&#8217;t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people&#8217;s thinking. Don&#8217;t let the noise of others&#8217; opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.<br />

> The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.<br />
