        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For one of the assignments in Cloud &amp; Big Data course at Columbia University, we had to display a Heat Map Layer showing positive and negative tweets from Twitter.  </p>


<p> Now, using Heatmaps with Google Maps is pretty trivial. Google Maps has pretty decent documentation along with working examples. </p>




<p>But how do we do it when we want to show muliple heat maps working independently on the same Google Map?</p>




<!--more-->




<p> Let&#8217;s take a closer look at the standard Heatmap example first. </p>


<p>Go through the example given <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/layer-heatmap" title="Heatmaps examples">here</a>.</p>

<p>As we see, the following piece of code is responsible for initializing the heat map. It also has a function called changeGradient() which is of interest to us. </p>




<pre>
<code class="javascript">

function initialize() {
  var mapOptions = {
    zoom: 13,
    center: new google.maps.LatLng(37.774546, -122.433523),
    mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.SATELLITE
  };

  map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map-canvas'),
      mapOptions);

  var pointArray = new google.maps.MVCArray(taxiData);

  heatmap = new google.maps.visualization.HeatmapLayer({
    data: pointArray
  });

  heatmap.setMap(map);
}


function changeGradient() {
  var gradient = [
    'rgba(0, 255, 255, 0)',
    'rgba(0, 255, 255, 1)',
    'rgba(0, 191, 255, 1)',
    'rgba(0, 127, 255, 1)',
    'rgba(0, 63, 255, 1)',
    'rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)',
    'rgba(0, 0, 223, 1)',
    'rgba(0, 0, 191, 1)',
    'rgba(0, 0, 159, 1)',
    'rgba(0, 0, 127, 1)',
    'rgba(63, 0, 91, 1)',
    'rgba(127, 0, 63, 1)',
    'rgba(191, 0, 31, 1)',
    'rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)'
  ]
  heatmap.set('gradient', heatmap.get('gradient') ? null : gradient);
}
</code> 
</pre>




<p>The changeGradient function changes the default gradient values to anything you specify. If you notice, the color is changing from light blue rgba(0, 255, 255, 0) for low density points to Sharp Red rgba(255, 0, 0, 1) as the density increases. 
</p>




<p>What you can simply do is, initiate two different heatmaps, say heatmapPositive (light blue to dark blue) and heatmapNegative (yellow to red) in case you want to show two different heat maps for the positive and negative sentiment tweets. </p>




<p>If you want sample code for this, you can find it <a href="https://github.com/BhavdeepSethi/cloudBigData/blob/master/twitterMapSource/twitMap.js" title="Github Link" >here</a>.  If you want to see how this looks, you can check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Qv7F_43dOk" >this video</a> which shows the default state and then with the dual heat maps. </p>




<p> If you want to do much more, there is this neat library called <a href="http://www.patrick-wied.at/static/heatmapjs/" title="heatmap.js">heatmap.js</a>. It has bunch of features like adding legends and tool tips, customized maps, etc. 
</p>




<p> Hope you found this useful. If you&#8217;re aware of any better libraries out there, then Let me know!</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We (my friend Vishnu and I) had reported a bug with MariaDB 10.0.4. Just got an update that the issue is fixed now! Here are the details about the bug:
We had setup maria 10.0.4 for multisource replication. It was replicating from a Percona 5.5 master. When we started replication, Maria was a day behind its master. It was working fine, but we noticed this phenomenon:
When we execute <code language="sql">show all slaves status</code> consecutively, the &lsquo;seconds_behind_master&rsquo; flips from 0 to XXX and XXX to 0.
Note: XXX is some positive number.</p>

        <link href="http://www.deepmusings.com/blog/2014/02/13/serving-static-content-with-dropwizard/"/>
        <updated>2014-02-13T19:22:37-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.deepmusings.com/blog/2014/02/13/serving-static-content-with-dropwizard</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dropwizard, in its own words is a &#8220;Java framework for developing ops-friendly, high-performance, RESTful web services&#8221;.</p>


<p>It is extremely lightweight, stable and mature, with most of the boilerplate code for configuration, application metrics, logging, alerting already built in.</p>


<p>In User Insights, Dropwizard powers our REST API. The same code base also hosts an internal console powered by BackboneJS which consumes these API&#8217;s for visualizing the results. Now, here is where the challenge comes in. By default, static files are part of the JAR that runs your application server. Any changes to the console (quite frequent) requires the JAR to be rebuilt and deployed on the server. I wanted to separate the static files required by the console so that the UI developer could deploy the console package as per his whims without having any dependency on the API JAR. At the same time I did not want to deploy another web server on the box just for these files.</p>


<p>One of the issues that most people face while serving static content with Dropwizard is how to serve these static files from outside the JAR. If you are one of those people, here is a post that you might find useful.</p>


<p>You can serve static content for your Dropwizard application efficiently in two ways: <span id="more-218"></span><br />
1) Using nginx<br />
2) Using a custom Asset Bundler</p>


<!--more-->


<p>1) Using nginx:<br />
You can configure nginx so that it serves all the static content, while unrecognized requests can be forwarded to your application server.<br />
Here is a sample config:</p>


<p><p><code>
<pre></p>

<h1>Site (port 80 -> 8080)</h1>

<p>server {
   listen          80;       # Listen on port 80 for IPv4 requests</p>

<p>   server_name localhost;</p>

<p>   access_log      /var/log/nginx/site_access.log;
   error_log       /var/log/nginx/site_error.log;</p>

<p>   # Set the root of the static content
   root /usr/share/nginx/html;</p>

<p>   # Redirect server error pages to the static page /50x.html
   error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
   location = /50x.html {
     root /usr/share/nginx/html;
   }</p>

<p>   # Filter static content types and serve from the root
   location ~*.(jpg|jpeg|gif|css|png|js|ico|html)$ {
     access_log off;
     expires max;
   }</p>

<p>   # Serve the dynamic content (Site)
   location / {
     # The application provides its own detailed logs
     access_log off;</p>

<pre><code> # Hand over to the application
 proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/;

 proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
 proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
 proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
</code></pre>

<p>   }</p>

<p>}
</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>For the above config, nginx is serving files with the any of the following extensions: <em>.jpg, </em>.jpeg, <em>.gif, </em>.css, <em>.png, </em>.js, <em>.ico, </em>.html.<br />
The location of these files should be: /usr/share/nginx/html<br />
Any other content is forwarded to your application server serving on port 8080 (default Dropwizard port).<br />
Any 50x error generated by your application server will cause a redirect to the /50x.html static file located at /usr/share/nginx/html</p>
<p>2) Using custom Asset Bundler:<br />
<a title="This github repo" href="https://github.com/bazaarvoice/dropwizard-configurable-assets-bundle" target="_blank">This github repo </a> hosts a drop in replacement for Dropwizard&rsquo;s AssetsBundle class which allows Assets (files) to be served from outside the jar.<br />
Many people find it difficult to use this plugin because of lack of proper documentation/examples.<br />
<a title="Here" href="https://github.com/BhavdeepFk/DropwizardAssets" target="_blank">Here</a> is a link to a sample project I created which shows the proper use of this plugin.</p>
<p>Hope you find this useful. If you have any suggestions/alternatives regarding this, then do let me know!</p></p>

        <link href="http://www.deepmusings.com/blog/2014/02/08/mysql-partial-replication/"/>
        <updated>2014-02-08T18:36:09-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.deepmusings.com/blog/2014/02/08/mysql-partial-replication</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of folks have asked me to elaborate more on partial replication.<br />
What is the use of replicating only certain tables? Can you add/remove tables/db to the existing replication? </p>


<p>Here is a follow up post to answer these and other such questions. </p>


<p>-What is Partial Replication?<br />
Partial replication is when your slave is replicating only certain db or tables from the master. </p>


<p>-What is the use of partial replication? </p>


<p><br /></p>

<!--more-->


<p>You might have cases where you might be storing a lot of data in your master instance, but only want to consume certain tables from the slave. If you&rsquo;re low on space, it makes sense replicating only the desired tables.<br />
There might be other reasons and this really depends on the application consuming the data.<br />
For instance, in Flipkart, most teams host their own instance of mysql on a different box. Online Marketing might want to consume some of this data for targeting purposes. For eg., you may want to send emails to all users who have bought books/mobiles and who reside in particular pincodes. Order related data is stored in the Order Management System (OMS), while user related data is stored in User Service. Using the API for bulk and complex queries can be inefficient. This is an example where you want to join two different sources. There are cases where we might want to make joins across 7-8 sources.<br />
To solve this problem, we&rsquo;re using MariaDB 10.0&#8242;s multi source replication. Each source maintains a lot of tables that is internal to their system. The marketing mysql slave instance selectively replicates from these sources so that it can consume relevant data for targeting.</p>

<p>-How do I do it?<br />
<span id="more-204"></span><br />
There are multiple ways to do this. Here is a good post covering some of the ways:<br />
<a href="http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2007/11/07/filtered-mysql-replication/" title="Partial Replication" target="_blank">http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2007/11/07/filtered-mysql-replication/</a></p>


<p>- Can you add/remove tables/db to existing replication?<br />
Yes! Follow the following steps:<br />
1) Run <code language="sql">stop slave</code> on the slave where you want to add the tables/db. Let&#8217;s call this target slave.<br />
2) Using method #3 from this post, take the dump of the required data.<br />
3) Using the replication parameters captured in step 2, use the following command to update the target slave:<br />
<br />
<code language="sql">
START SLAVE UNTIL MASTER_LOG_FILE='&lt;log_file&gt;', MASTER_LOG_POS=&lt;log_position&gt;; 
</code>
<br />
The above command starts replication till the &#8216;log_position&#8217; and then stops the slave itself.<br />
4) Now, load the dumped data on the target slave.<br />
5) If you&#8217;re replicating using replicate-do-db or replicate-do-table, add the new tables to the conf file and restart the target slave.<br />
6) Run <code language="sql">start slave</code> on the target slave and watch the new tables getting the new data! :) </p>


<p>- Is it safe?<br />
Well, yes and no. It works just like normal replication so yes, it is safe. No, in terms of the slight increase in chance of breaking replication.<br />
Say you are replicating only table tA, tB and tC from DB dbA. Now, if a DML command is run which uses cross join of dbA and dbB to update data from table tA, then yes, replication may break if you&#8217;re using statement based replication. </p>


<p>- If I am using slave status to find the replication parameters, then which slave parameters should I consider?<br />
For replication to start, the mysql instance needs the name of the log file it needs to read, and the position at which it should start reading from this file. For a slave, there is a difference between the IO thread reading the binlogs and the SQL thread executing the commands on the existing slave.<br />
The <code language="sql">show slave status</code> command has three log files and there might be confusion as to which log file to use.<br />
If you are taking the dump from an existing slave, the data that the current slave holds depends on the position of the SQL thread running and not the IO thread.<br />
Mapping this to the &#8220;show slave status&#8221; command, the only parameters you should consider are Relay_Master_Log_File and Exec_Master_Log_Pos. </p>


<p>Hope this helps! If you have any further questions on MySQL partial replication, do let me know.</p>
