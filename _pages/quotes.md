<p>I love collecting quotes. Whenever I read something profound, I make it a point to note it down. These quotes may be from famous people, image-quotes from FB, articles I&#8217;ve read, movies or just from day to day conversations. I&#8217;ve tried my best to credit the correct/original author for most of these but if I&#8217;m wrong, do point it out.</p>
<p>	Let me know which among these do you like or mention any other quotes that you find worth remembering.</p>
