  <p>I love collecting quotes. Whenever I read something profound, I make it a point to note it down. These quotes may be from famous people, image-quotes from FB, articles I&#8217;ve read, movies or just from day to day conversations. I&#8217;ve tried my best to credit the correct/original author for most of these but if I&#8217;m wrong, do point it out.</p>


<p> Let me know which among these do you like or mention any other quotes that you find worth remembering.</p>

<hr width="100%" />
<p>I always wonder why birds stay in the same place when they can fly anywhere on the earth. Then I ask myself the same question.<br />
<span class="alignright author">-Harun Yahya</span></p>
<hr width="100%" />
<p>It doesn’t matter how many times you fail. It doesn’t matter how many times you almost get it right. No one is going to know or care about your failures, and neither should you. All you have to do is learn from them and those around you. Because all that matters in business is that you get it right once. Then everyone can tell you how lucky you are.<br />
    <span class="alignright author">-Mark Cuban</span></p>
<hr width="100%" />
<p>When they score the winning point or sell their company for millions &#8211; you&#8217;re seeing them in their moment of glory. What you don&#8217;t see is the thousands of hours of preparation. You don&#8217;t see the self doubt, the lost sleep, the lonely nights spent working. You don&#8217;t see the moment they started. The moment they were just like you, wondering how they could ever be good.<br />
    <span class="alignright author">-Unknown</span></p>
<hr width="100%" />
<p>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.<br />
    <span class="alignright author">-Theodore Roosevelt, The Man in the Arena</span></p>
<hr width="100%" />
<p>In light of knowledge attained, the happy achievement seems almost a matter of course, and any intelligent student can grasp it without too much trouble. But the years of anxious searching in the dark, with their intense longing, their alterations of confidence and exhaustion and the final emergence into the light &#8212; only those who have experienced it can understand it.<br />
    <span class="alignright author">-Einstein</span></p>
<hr width="100%" />
<p>Your time is limited, so don&#8217;t waste it living someone else&#8217;s life. Don&#8217;t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people&#8217;s thinking. Don&#8217;t let the noise of others&#8217; opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.<br />
    <span class="alignright author">-Steve Jobs</span></p>
<hr width="100%" />
<p>The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.<br />
    <span class="alignright author">-Albert Camus</span></p>
<hr width="100%" />
<p>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,<br />
    I took the one less traveled by,<br />
    And that has made all the difference.<br />

<hr width="100%" />
<p>Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.<br />
    <span class="alignright author">-Samuel Beckett</span></p>
<hr width="100%" />
<p>Courage does not always roar. Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying &#8220;I will try again tomorrow&#8221;.</p>
<hr width="100%" />
<p>Here&#8217;s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They&#8217;re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can&#8217;t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.<br />
    <span class="alignright author">-Steve Jobs</span></p>

<hr width="100%" />
<p>Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn&#8217;t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbour. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.<br />
    <span class="alignright author">-Mark Twain</span></p>
<hr width="100%" />
<p>When you come to the end of your rope, tie a knot and hang on.<br />
    <span class="alignright author">-Franklin D. Roosevelt</span></p>
<hr width="100%" />
<p>Don&#8217;t ever let someone tell you that you can&#8217;t do something. Not even me. You got a dream, you gotta protect it. When people can&#8217;t do something themselves, they&#8217;re gonna tell you that you can&#8217;t do it. You want something, go get it. Period.<br />
    <span class="alignright author">-Will Smith, The Pursuit of Happiness</span></p>
<hr width="100%" />
<p>Never give up on what you really want to do. The person with big dreams is more powerful than the one with all the facts.<br />
    <span class="alignright author">-Unknown</span></p>

<hr width="100%" />
<p>Do not go where the path may lead; go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.</p>
<hr width="100%" />
<p>Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the judgement that something else is more important than fear.<br />

    We&#8217;ll get to know ourselves again and we&#8217;ll heal our hearts,<br />
    It&#8217;s not that we&#8217;re bad together, it&#8217;s just we&#8217;re better off apart.</p>
<hr width="100%" />
<p>Today I&#8217;ll give it one last try<br />
    and then I know I&#8217;ll wonder why<br />
    I did it to myself once again.<br />

<p>I imagine that one of the reason people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once the hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with pain.</p>

<p>Sometimes what you forget doesn’t bother you nearly as much as what you remember.</p>
<hr width="100%" />
<p>Letting go does not mean giving up, but simply accepting the fact that there are things that just cannot be.</p>
<hr width="100%" />
<p>Sometimes you have to just swallow your pride and accept that you’re wrong. It’s not called giving up, it’s called growing up.</p>

<p>Monsters are real, ghosts are real too. They live inside us, and sometimes, they win.<br />

<p>Time heals everything. Give time, time.</p>

<p>The world is full of magic you just have to believe in it.</p>

<p>Never give up on anybody. Miracles happen every day.</p>

<p>A broken plane, A broken dream,<br />
    A broken heart, a broken team,<br />
    no words said, a silent vow,<br />
    we loved you then, we love you now.<br />
