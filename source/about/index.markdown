<p>I’m <a title="Bhavdeep" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhavdeep" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Bhavdeep</a>. My friends call me BDS/Deep. Not Deep as in depth, but Deep as in the <a title="Sanskrit" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit" target="_blank">Sanskrit</a> word दीप, meaning light/enlightened.</p>
<p>I graduated from KJSCE, <a title="University of Mumbai" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=18.975,72.8258333333&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=18.975,72.8258333333 (University%20of%20Mumbai)&amp;t=h" target="_blank" rel="geolocation">University of Mumbai</a> in 2010.</p>
<p>I started out my career at a startup called MIME360 (Mallers Inc.) as a Full Stack Developer. MIME360 was acquired by <a title="Flipkart" href="http://www.flipkart.com/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Flipkart.com</a> back in October, 2011. I am currently a graduate student (MS in CS) at Columbia University, New York.   

<p>I love reading technology blogs. When not lurking on <a title="Hypoglossal nucleus" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">HN</a>, you’ll find me trying to complete my book collection. My aim is to own a mini-library (5k+ books) by 2020. :P</p>
<p>I’m a soccer fanatic and a die hard Manchester United supporter! I prefer playing as a center back or as a defensive mid-fielder.</p>
<p>And finally, I love travelling. Before joining Columbia, I went on backpacking in India and covered around 10 states in three weeks. Watch out for a post on that!

<p>Now, why is the blog called "Deep Musings"?</p>
<p>It’s actually a play on words. Not only the posts here involve deep contemplative thoughts (ahem), but they are also my (Deep) personal opinions! :P </p>
