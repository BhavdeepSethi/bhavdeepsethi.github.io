The first career fair I ever attended in Columbia was somewhere around October 17, 2015. It was an <i>interesting</i> experience. So much energy, meeting new people...and of course, bunch of free swag. ;)
</p>
The first few interview calls I got were from Snapchat and Dataminr. While I've been conducting interviews from the past three years, I don't have much experience sitting on the other end of the table. This is how my first interview went. <br />

<pre>
Snapchat guy: Hey, do you use Snapchat? 
Me: -looking at my Windows phone- Umm...not really. 
Snapchat guy: So, what do you want to do here? 
Me: Um...that's a good question.

I was supposed to code using coderpad and I wasn't aware that it compiles the program on saving it. Ended up writing code like you do on a piece of paper. By the end of it, I had compilation errors as well. Needless to say, I tanked the Snapchat interview. I realized I wasn't prepared. <br />

The next interview was with Dataminr. By that time, I had started preparing for interviews. The interview went pretty well, as far as I was concerned, but I didn't hear anything from them for a month. I reached out to them and they said they didn't want to move ahead. Hmm...alright then. Least they could have done was informed me earlier. But these things happen quite often from what I've read online. <br />

Post this, I applied to couple of companies via the college portal. Got a call from GoldmanSachs Strats group. After the initial screening, they invited me for the SuperDay. The interviews went pretty well and got an offer from them after two weeks. But frankly, I really wanted to work in a startup so I started working towards that. <br />

I was invited to attend a startup fair by FirstMark Elite, a Venture Capital fund. I interviewed with Symphony Commerce, Conductor and Live Gamer. I had an amazing time talking to each of them. Eventually, I decided to move ahead with Symphony Commerce. <br />

I had two phone interviews with Symphony Commerce. The first one was with Stanley Chan, Head of Core &amp; Infrastructure.  The next interview was with Art Rivilis, Head of Engineerying at Symphony. I had a really good technical discussion with both of them and the projects they mentioned seemed really exciting. I got an offer from them. :) <br />

Sometime before the FirstMark Elite event, Shannon Harrington from TellApart reached out to me. I hadn't heard about the company before so I checked out their company blogs. I realized their work was pretty identical to my last project (User Insights) at Flipkart. Shannon is by far the most amazing HR person I've worked with. I was discussing lamda architecture with her on my first call. Hell, I've not been able to do that with some of the most brilliant engineers I've worked with. 
I knew I had to join TellApart. <br />

TellApart took two phone interviews. After those, they flew me to the Burlingame office for three more interviews. Each interview had two interviewers. The first interview (taken by Mike Chang and Matt Forbes) consisted of reviewing piece of code they had shared with me few days back. The scope of the problem soon changed and we were discussing how the code will adapt to it. 
The second was with the team I was supposed to join. Jesh Bratman and Sean Xie deep dived into my User Insights project adding new scenarios along the way. The last one with Wade (VP of Engg) and Kevin (Engineering Manager) was more around culture fit. <br />

Got a spot offer from them and it was too hard to say no. I turned down an offer from Amazon and interview calls from Pinterest and Facebook. TellApart was my top choice and I was glad it all worked out. <br />

A month before my internship started, Twitter acquired TellApart. So I'll be interning with Twitter in the summer now. :)
I'll write a post about how that goes!
