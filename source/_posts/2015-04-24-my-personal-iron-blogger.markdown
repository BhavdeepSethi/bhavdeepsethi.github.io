I noticed one of my <a href="http://www.sheki.in/">friends</a> had joined <a href="http://iron-blogger-sf.com/the-rules/" >Iron blogger</a>. The idea is that you write a blog post every week. If you miss a week, you add $5 to a common pool. Even though he has been slacking for the past few weeks, I still think it's a pretty cool way to keep you motivated. I tried looking for the NY chapter, couldn't find it and then got busy with assignments. </p>

<p>
Few days back, during one of the random tweet session with <a href="https://twitter.com/sushibar_92" >Surashree</a> (let's stalk her together) , she and I decided that we're gonna prod each other to come up with a new post every week. So, now I have my own personal Iron Blogger. Heh. How about that! I think this is better than the original group thingie because we can actually harass each other if we don't follow this dedicatedly. The downside is you can expect lots of spam from of us henceforth. ;)

Hmm...still need to come up with some sort of penalty for missing a post though.
